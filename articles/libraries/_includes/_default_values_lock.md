### Default Values

Lock 11 will default the [scope](/scopes) parameter to `'openid profile email'`. This is to make the **Last time you logged in with** window work correctly.

If you don't specify that scope when initializing Lock, and you are running your website from `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`, you will get the following error in the browser console:

```text
Consent required. When using `getSSOData`, the user has to be authenticated with the following scope: `openid profile email`
```

That will not happen when you run your application in production or if you specify the required [scope](/scopes). You can read more about this in the [User consent and third-party clients document](/api-auth/user-consent#skipping-consent-for-first-party-clients).
