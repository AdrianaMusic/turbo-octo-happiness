# Call an Identity Provider API

Once you successfully authenticate a user with an external Identity Provider (IdP), such as Facebook or GitHub, the IdP often includes an access token in the user profile it returns to Auth0. 

You can retrieve and use this token to call the IdP's API.

::: note
This doc assumes that you have already configured the connection with the IdP of your choice. If not, refer to [Identity Providers Supported by Auth0](/identityproviders), where you can find a list of the supported IdPs. Select the one you want for detailed steps on how to configure the connection.
:::

## Required Steps

The IdP's access token is not returned to your app as part of the authentication process. In order to get it you will have to use the Auth0 Management API to retrieve the full user's profile. The steps to follow are:

1. Get an access token that allows you to call the [Auth0 Management API](/api/management/v2).
2. Call the Auth0 Management API's [Get Users by ID](/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users_by_id) endpoint, using the access token obtained in step one. This endpoint returns the full user's profile, which contains the IdP access token.
3. Extract the IdP access token from the response and use it to call the IdP's API.

### 1. Get a Token

You will need an access token to call the [Management API](/api/management/v2).

If this is the first time you are requesting a [Management APIv2 Token](/api/management/v2/tokens), you will need to create and configure a client that can be used to call the API.

To do so, go to [Dashboard > APIs > Auth0 Management API > API Explorer](${manage_url}/#/apis/management/explorer) and click **Create & Authorize a Test Client**.

This will create a new client and grant **all scopes of the Management API**. This means that the tokens generated for this client will be able to access **all Management API endpoints**.

::: panel Can't see the button?
If you don't see this button, it means that you have at least one authorized client already. In this case you can either update the scopes of an existing client and use that, or create a new one following these steps:
1. Go to [Dashboard > Clients](${manage_url}/#/clients)
2. Click **+ Create Client**, select **Non Interactive Clients** and click **Create**
3. At the **Select an API** dropdown select `Auth0 Management API`
4. Click **Navigate to the API and Authorize**
5. Set the toggle to **Authorized** and enable the required scopes
:::

It is recommended, for security reasons, that you only assign the required scopes to the client you will be using. For this particular case, the scopes you need are: `read:users`, `read:user_idp_tokens`.

You can grant or remove scopes from a client, at the [Dashboard > APIs > Auth0 Management API > Non Interactive Clients tab](${manage_url}/#/apis/management/authorized-clients).

![Edit the scopes granted to the Client](/media/articles/connections/edit-granted-scopes.png)

You are now done with the configuration part, and you are ready to get your Management API token.

To do so, go to the [Test tab](${manage_url}/#/apis/management/test). There you can find ready-to-use snippets that you can use to get a token.

Pick your client using the dropdown at the top, and choose your language of preference for the snippet.

Copy and run the snippet. Extract the `access_token` property from the response. This is what you will use to access the Management API.

::: panel More info on the snippets
The snippets make a `POST` operation to the [/oauth/token endpoint of the Auth0 Authentication API](/api/authentication#client-credentials), using the **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials grant**. This is the grant that machine-to-machine processes utilize in order to access an API. For more information on the grant, refer to [Calling APIs from a Service](/api-auth/grant/client-credentials).
:::

#### Token expiration

The token you received has, by default, an expiration time of 24 hours (86400 seconds). To change this, update the **Token Expiration (Seconds)** field, at the [Settings tab](${manage_url}/#/apis/management/settings) and save your changes. The next token you generate will use the updated expiration time.

::: panel-warning Security warning
These tokens **cannot be revoked**. To minimize the risk, we recommend issuing short-lived tokens (and granting only the necessary scopes for each client). For a production environment you can configure a simple CLI that will fetch a new token when the old one expires. You can find a sample implementation in Python [here](/api/management/v2/tokens#sample-implementation-python).
:::

### 2. Get the full User Profile

Using the access token you got in the previous section, call the [Get a User endpoint of the Management API](/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users_by_id), in order to get a user's profile:

```har
{
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/users/USER_ID",
    "httpVersion": "HTTP/1.1",
    "cookies": [],
    "headers": [{
        "name": "Authorization",
        "value": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    }]
}
```

Replace these values:
- `USER_ID`: The ID of the user for whom you want to call the IdP's API.
- `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`: The token you got from the previous step.

::: panel Where do I find the User ID?
- For testing purposes, you can find a user ID at [Dashboard > Users](${manage_url}/#/users/). Select a user and copy the value of the **user_id** field.
- For your implementation, you can either extract this information from the [ID Token](/tokens/id-token) (get the value of the claim **sub**), or call the [/userinfo endpoint of the Authentication API](/api/authentication#get-user-info) (get the value of the response property **user_id**).
:::


### 3. Extract the IdP Access Token

Within the user's `identities` array, there will be an `access_token` that you can extract and use to make calls to the IdP's API: `user.identities[0].access_token`.

::: note
For certain Identity Providers, Auth0 will store a `refresh_token` which you can use to obtain a new `access_token` for the IdP. This works for: BitBucket, Google (OAuth 2.0), OAuth 2.0, SharePoint, Azure AD. For more information, refer to [Identity Provider Access Tokens](/tokens/idp#renewing-the-token).
:::

In most cases, the user will only have one identity, but if you have used the [account linking feature](/link-accounts), there may be more.

In this sample response we can see that our user had only one identity: `google-oauth2`.

```json
{
  "email": "john.doe@test.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "given_name": "John",
  "family_name": "Doe",

  "gender": "male",
  "locale": "en",

      "user_id": "111199914890750704174",
      "connection": "google-oauth2",
      "isSocial": true
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2017-03-15T07:13:41.134Z",
  "last_ip": "127.0.0.1",
  "last_login": "2017-03-15T07:14:32.451Z",
  "logins_count": 99
}
```

You are now ready to call the IdP's API. Please refer to the IdP's documentation for specifics on how to do so.

::: warning
Make sure that you don't expose the IdP tokens to your client-side application!
