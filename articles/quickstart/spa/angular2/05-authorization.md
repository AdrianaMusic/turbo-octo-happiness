## Handle Scopes in the `AuthService`

Adjust your `AuthService` to use a local member with any `scope`s you would like to request when users log in. Use this member in the `auth0.WebAuth` instance.

```ts
// src/app/auth/auth.service.ts

requestedScopes: string = 'openid profile read:messages write:messages';

auth0 = new auth0.WebAuth({
  // ...
  scope: this.requestedScopes
});
``` 

In the `setSession` method, save the `scope`s granted for the user into local storage. The first place to check for these granted `scope` values is the `scope` key from the `authResult`. If something exists there it's because the `scope`s which were granted for the user differ from those that were requested. If there is nothing on `authResult.scope`, it means that the granted `scope`s match those that were requested, so the requested values can be used directly. If there are no values for either of these, you can fall back to an empty string.

```ts
// src/app/auth/auth.service.ts

private setSession(authResult): void {

  const scopes = authResult.scope || this.requestedScopes || '';

  // ...
  localStorage.setItem('scopes', JSON.stringify(scopes));
}
```

Add a method called `userHasScopes` which will check for a particular `scope` in local storage. This method should take an array of strings and check whether the array of `scope`s saved in local storage contains those values. This method can be used to conditionally hide and show various UI elements and to limit route access.

```ts
// src/app/auth/auth.service.ts

public userHasScopes(scopes: Array<string>): boolean {
  const grantedScopes = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('scopes')).split(' ');
  return scopes.every(scope => grantedScopes.includes(scope));
}
```

## Conditionally Dislay UI Elements

The `userHasScopes` method can now be used alongside `isAuthenticated` to conditionally show and hide certain UI elements based on those two conditions.

```html
<!-- src/app/app.component.html -->

<button
  class="btn btn-primary btn-margin"
  *ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated() && auth.userHasScopes(['write:messages'])"
  routerLink="/admin">
    Admin Area
</button>
```

## Protect Client-Side Routes

For some routes in your application, you may want to only allow access if the user is authenticated. This check can be made with the `canActivate` hook.

Create a new service called `AuthGuardService`.

```ts
// src/app/auth/auth-guard.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Router, CanActivate } from '@angular/router';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
export class AuthGuardService implements CanActivate {

  constructor(public auth: AuthService, public router: Router) {}

  canActivate(): boolean {
    if (!this.auth.isAuthenticated()) {
      this.router.navigate(['']);
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }

}
```

In your route configuration, apply the `AuthGuardService` to the `canActivate` hook for whichever routes you wish to protect.

```ts
// src/app/app.routes.ts

import { AuthGuardService as AuthGuard } from './auth/auth-guard.service';

export const ROUTES: Routes = [
  // ...
  { path: 'profile', component: ProfileComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard] },
  { path: 'ping', component: PingComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard] },
];
```

The guard implements the `CanActivate` interface which requires a method called `canActivate` in the service. This method returns `true` if the user is authenticated and `false` if not. It also navigates the user to the home route if they aren't authenticated.

### Limit Route Access Based on `scope`

To prevent access to client-side routes based on a particular `scope`, create another service called `ScopeGuard`. This service should use `ActivatedRouteSnapshot` to check for a set of `expectedScopes` passed in the `data` key of the route configuration.

```ts
// src/app/auth/scope-guard.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Router, CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot } from '@angular/router';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
export class ScopeGuardService implements CanActivate {

  constructor(public auth: AuthService, public router: Router) {}

  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): boolean {

    const scopes = route.data.expectedScopes;

    if (!this.auth.isAuthenticated() || !this.auth.userHasScopes(scopes)) {
      this.router.navigate(['']);
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }

}
```

```ts
// src/app/app.routes.ts

import { ScopeGuardService as ScopeGuard } from './auth/scope-guard.service';

export const ROUTES: Routes = [
  // ...
  { path: 'admin', component: AdminComponent, canActivate: [ScopeGuard], data: { expectedScopes: ['write:messages']} },
];
```

The user will now be redirected to the main route unless they have a `scope` of `write:messages`.
