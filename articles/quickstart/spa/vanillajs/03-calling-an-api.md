## Set the Audience and Scope in `auth0.WebAuth`

Pass the API identifier for your newly created API as the `audience` value in your `auth0.WebAuth` instance. Additionally, pass any of your newly created scopes to the `scope` key.

```js
// app.js

var webAuth = new auth0.WebAuth({
  // ...
  audience: '${apiIdentifier}',
  scope: 'openid profile read:messages'
});
```

::: note
**Checkpoint:** At this point you should try logging into your application again to take note of how the `access_token` differs from before. Instead of being an opaque token, it is now a JSON Web Token which has a payload that contains your API identifier as an `audience` and any `scope`s you've requested.

::: note
By default, any user on any client can ask for any scope defined in the scopes configuration area. You can implement access policies to limit this behaviour via [Rules](/rules).

## Configure a Custom XHR Request

<%= include('../_includes/_calling_api_access_token') %>

Attaching the user's `access_token` as an `Authorization` header to HTTP calls can be done on a one-off basis by adding the header as an option to your requests. However, it is recommended that you implement a custom function which does this automatically.

Create a new function called `callAPI` which wraps an XHR request with the user's `access_token` included as the `Authorization` header.

```js
// app.js

var apiUrl = 'http://localhost:3001/api';

// ...
function callAPI(endpoint, secured) {
  var url = apiUrl + endpoint;
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('GET', url);
  if (secured) {
    xhr.setRequestHeader(
      'Authorization',
      'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('access_token')
    );
  }
  xhr.onload = function() {
    if (xhr.status == 200) {
      // update message
      document.querySelector('#ping-view h2').innerHTML = JSON.parse(
        xhr.responseText
      ).message;
    } else {
      alert('Request failed: ' + xhr.statusText);
    }
  };
  xhr.send();
}
```
