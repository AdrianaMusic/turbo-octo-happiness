In the `setSession` method, save the `scope`s granted for the user into local storage. The first place to check for these granted `scope` values is the `scope` key from the `authResult`. If something exists there it's because the `scope`s which were granted for the user differ from those that were requested. If there is nothing on `authResult.scope`, it means that the granted `scope`s match those that were requested, so the requested values can be used directly. If there are no values for either of these, you can fall back to an empty string.
