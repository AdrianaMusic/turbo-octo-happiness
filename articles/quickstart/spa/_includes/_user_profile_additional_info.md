## Updating a User's Profile

Auth0 provides a `user_metadata` object for all users. This object is intended to store information that can be modified by the user and is a useful place to keep data that is meant to be user-defined. See the [management API documentation](api/management/v2) for more information on how to allow users to make edits to their own profile information.
