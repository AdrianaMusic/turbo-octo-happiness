## Install angular-lock

Using Lock in your AngularJS application requires a thin wrapper called **angular-lock**. Install it with npm or yarn.

```bash
# installation with npm
npm install --save angular-lock

# installation with yarn
yarn add angular-lock
```

Once **angular-lock** is installed, add it to your build system or bring it in to your project as a script tag.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/angular-auth0/dist/angular-lock.js"></script>
```
