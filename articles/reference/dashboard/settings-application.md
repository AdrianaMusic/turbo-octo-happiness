# Application Settings

In the [Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications) section, locate your Application and click on the cog to review its available settings:

![Application Settings Page](/media/articles/applications/settings.png)

- **Name**: The name of your application. This information is editable and you will see in the portal, emails, logs, and so on.

- **Domain**: Your Auth0 tenant name. Note that the domain name is chosen when you create a new Auth0 tenant and cannot be changed. If you need a different one you have to register for a new tenant by selecting **+ Create Tenant** in the top right menu.

- **Client ID**: The unique identifier for your application. This is the ID you will use with when configuring authentication with Auth0. It is generated by the system when you create a new application and it cannot be modified.

- **Client Secret**: A string used to sign and validate ID Tokens for authentication flows and to gain access to select Auth0 API endpoints. By default, the value is hidden, so check the **Reveal Client Secret** box to see this value.

  ::: warning
  While the Client ID is considered public information, the Client Secret **must be kept confidential**. If anyone can access your Client Secret they can issue  tokens and access resources they shouldn't.
  :::

- **Description**: A free-text description of the Application's purpose with a maximum of 140 characters.

- **Application Logo**: The URL to a logo (recommended size: 150x150 pixels) to be displayed for the application. This will appear in several areas, including the list of applications in the Dashboard, as well as things like customized consent forms.

- **Application Type**: The type of application you are implementing. Choose the corresponding [Auth0 Application Type](/applications/reference/application-types).

::: note
You can provide up to 100 URLs in the **Allowed Callback URLs**, **Allowed Web Origins**, **Allowed Logout URLs**, **Allowed Origins (CORS)** fields.
:::

- **Allowed Callback URLs**: Set of URLs to which Auth0 is allowed to redirect the users after they authenticate. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them (typically to handle different environments like QA or testing). For production environments, verify that the URLs do not point to localhost. You can use the star symbol as a wildcard for subdomains (`*.google.com`). Make sure to specify the protocol, `http://` or `https://`, otherwise the callback may fail in some cases.

- **Allowed Web Origins**: List of URLs from where an authorization request, using [`web_message` as the response mode](/protocols/oauth2#how-response-mode-works), can originate from. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them. For production environments, verify that the URLs do not point to localhost.

- **Allowed Logout URLs**: After a user logs out from Auth0 you can redirect them with the `returnTo` query parameter. The URL that you use in `returnTo` must be listed here. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them.  For production environments, verify that the URLs do not point to localhost. You can use the star symbol as a wildcard for subdomains (`*.google.com`). Notice that querystrings and hash information are not taken into account when validating these URLs. Read more about this at: [Logout](/logout).

- **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: Set of URLs that will be allowed to make requests from JavaScript to Auth0 API (typically used with CORS). This prevents same-origin policy errors when using Auth0 from within a web browser. By default, all your callback URLs will be allowed. This field allows you to enter other origins if you need to. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them. For production environments, verify that the URLs do not point to localhost. You can use the star symbol as a wildcard for subdomains (`*.google.com`). Notice that paths, querystrings and hash information are not taken into account when validating these URLs (and may, in fact, cause the match to fail).

- **JWT Expiration (seconds)**: The amount of time (in seconds) before the Auth0 ID Token expires. The default value is `36000`, which maps to 10 hours.

- **Use Auth0 instead of the IdP to do Single Sign On**: If enabled, this setting prevents Auth0 from redirecting authenticated users with valid sessions to the identity provider (such as Facebook, ADFS, and so on).

For Single-Page and M2M Applications, you will also see:

- **Token Endpoint Authentication Method**: Defines the requested authentication method for the token endpoint. Possible values are `None` (public client without a client secret), `Post` (client uses HTTP POST parameters) or `Basic` (client uses HTTP Basic).
