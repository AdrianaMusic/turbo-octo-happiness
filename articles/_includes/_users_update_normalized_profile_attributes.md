By default, normalized user profile attributes are not directly editable since they are updated from the identity provider each time a user logs in. If you want to be able to edit the `name`, `nickname`, `given_name`, `family_name`, or `picture` attributes on the normalized user profile, you must [enable a connection to allow updates to the normalized user profile](/connections/guides/allow-update-normalized-user-profile). When enabled, user attributes will be updated from the identity provider only on user profile creation and will be available to be edited with the Management API's [Update a user endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Users/patch_users_by_id).
