# Introduction

The Authentication API exposes the identity functionality of Auth0, as well as the supported identity protocols like [OpenID Connect](/protocols/oidc), [OAuth 2.0](/protocols/oauth2), and [SAML](/protocols/saml).

If you want to implement authentication in your application, it is suggested that you reference our [Quickstart Tutorials](/quickstarts) which walk you through the implementation for a wide range of technologies and platforms.

You can make use of the Authentication API by making the HTTP requests yourself or by making use of the [Auth0.js library](/libraries/auth0js). You can also use the [Lock widget](/libraries/lock) for web applications, or alternatively you can make use of [Lock for iOS](/libraries/lock-ios/v2) and [Lock for Android](/libraries/lock-android).

We also have SDKs available for [.NET](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.net), [Java](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0-java), [Node](https://github.com/auth0/node-auth0), [PHP](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-php) and [Python](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-python), or alternatively you can use any middleware in your web applications which supports OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0.

For each endpoint in this document you will find sample snippets you can use, in three available formats:
- HTTP request
- Curl command
- JavaScript: depending on the endpoint each snippet may use the [Auth0.js library](/libraries/auth0js), Node.js code or simple JavaScript
