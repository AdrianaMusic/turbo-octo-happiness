# TL;DR: Style Guide Highlights

## Introduction
Use this starter kit when you want to create new doc content or update existing content on auth0.com/docs. We are very flexible about how we can add content to Auth0 Documentation set; everything from sending us a DM in Slack to have us write content for you, to writing your own content in Markdown in our GitHub repository. We can work with you to determine the way that works best for you.

This is a brief list of some of the most important points and some of the most common issues. Our **Auth0 Writing Style Guide** is mostly intended for reference; we don't expect you to read it straight through. This page doesn't provide details or justifications; for more info about topics on this page, follow the links.
